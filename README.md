# solution-to-plfa

My solution to _Programming Language Foundations in Agda_ (available at [https://plfa.github.io](https://plfa.github.io/))

## Getting Started

The `template` branch contains a bare solution scaffold. You could fork this repo and use it to write your own solutions to PLFA.

### Setup

[WIP]

#### Install Haskell

[WIP]

#### Install Agda
